Debugging:

For running efficiency:
-

# Adding a symlink in the bin
# everytime I edit the qiime2 pipeline in my thesis folder, it will update the bin
# bin is in my path so it will executed from wherever I am
-ln -s ~/Documents/thesis/16S/qiime2/qiime2_pipeline/qiime2_* ~/bin/

# changing permissions making qiime2_pipeline executable (x)
-chmod u+x /Users/danielle/Documents/thesis/16S/qiime2/qiime2_pipeline/qiime2_pipeline

# if you are having problems with scikit-learn versions
# make sure you are using the most up to date classifier
conda install --override-channels -c defaults scikit-learn=0.20.2
